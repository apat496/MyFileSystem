Our filesystem is very simplistic in style and implementation. The main
advantage to this is how quick and easy it was to implement all of the required
features. Another advantage is that the filesystem is highly optimized for
small files. Both read and write calls have a very early cutoff in the storage
code if the size of a file is less than 1 block. There are certainly drawbacks,
as there are in any filesystem. One major drawback is that having only a single
indirect block means that only files up to 4MB are supported. This is obviously
sufficient for the purpose of this assignment, but clearly not sufficient for
practical use. Time being the limiting factor, we would not improve anything. 
We were able complete all of the features in a very reasonable timeframe. If 
writing filesystems was the sort of thing we enjoyed, we would consider
implementing more than 1 direct block for faster retrieval of non trivial 
small files as well as extents to improve retrieval of larger files. We might
also implement some sort of garbage collection process to coalesce data blocks
for fragmented files. However, we were happy with our basic implementation and
we did not implement anything more than was required.
